[20100531] added pure random sequence lookup for feasibility and quality improvement operators

[20090803] removed requirement for gsl lib. added compile switch 'SPRNG' to use sprng only

[20090713] on TACC, we got mpi user buffer overflow problem. i changed ga-asyn.c and ga.h to have recv_imi() frequency 2 times faster than send_emi()

[20090623] corrected sprng initialization: if using MPI, all processes must use the same seed (make_sprng_seed() will do this for me)
